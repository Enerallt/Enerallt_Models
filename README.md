# Enerallt
This repository hosts Enerallt, a multi-country power market and district heating model, developed and maintained by Energy Efficiency and Systems Laboratory, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Aalto University, Finland. 
The model is an hourly simulation of operation and dipatch of power plants, combined heat and power (CHP) plants, and heating plants in a group of countries (or price areas) interconnected in a common power market. The model is calibrated for the Nordic power market (Finland, Norway, Sweden, West Denmark, and East Denmark). The main features include:
1. Simulation of hydropower water values at the country level
2. Modelling of hourly district heating demand and supply, and CHP plants connected to both electricity and DH systems
3. Electricity market clearance based on the day-ahead cycle, and adaptation of power supply based on the outcome of the market in the past runs (limited foresight)
